I completed a B.S. in biology in May 2024 at Penn State Behrend in Erie, Pennsylvania.\nMy research interests include behavioral ecology and herpetology (i.e., the study of amphibians and reptiles). In particular, I am interested in studying amphibian responses to anthropogenic disturbances, such as habitat destruction and degradation. These activities threaten over 40% of amphibian species across the world, making them the most-threatened group of vertebrates. I hope to use my work to inform conservation efforts that protect these animals.\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential collaborations.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

For a full list of my previous research projects, please see my curriculum vitae.\n\nInvestigating Transgenerational Epigenetic Effects in a Freshwater Snail\nOrganisms’ observable characteristics can be altered by direct experiences (i.e., within-generation plasticity), or experiences of previous generations (i.e., transgenerational plasticity). Transgenerational plasticity can help offspring overcome environmental stressors, like predators, by using information about the environment that is passed from the genes of their parent(s). In certain species, such as simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can reproduce by either mating with others or self-fertilizing, the quantity of inherited information may be different between offspring. Physa are a genus of freshwater snails that are simultaneous hermaphrodites and can produce offspring by either mechanism. The objective of my work was to compare the transgenerational effects of predation risk in Physa offspring produced by mating versus by self-fertilization.\n\n\n\nSnail egg mass under a microscope (Physa spp.)\n\n\n\n\nDetermining the Population Size of Spotted Salamanders\nHumans can negatively impact amphibian populations by degrading and fragmenting their natural habitats. In the early 2000s, a large roadway was constructed on Penn State Behrend’s campus, which separated several ponds and other wetland habitats. Many species of amphibians, including spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) migrate to these ponds annually to breed. Habitat fragmentation and degradation may impact the size and success of their population at these locations. The objective of this work was to estimate the population size of spotted salamanders at ponds on campus using mark-recapture methods.\n\n\n\nAdult spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum)\n\n\n\n\nInvestigating the population size of invasive Mysterysnails\nInvasive species threaten native communities by competing with native species and reducing biodiversity. Non-native mysterysnails (Cipangopaludina spp.) are aquatic snails native to Asia. They were introduced into the United States via the pet trade and have been established as an invasive population in Presque Isle State Park (PISP), in Erie, Pennsylvania. However, the size and distribution of the population is unknown. The objective of this work was to determine the abundance and distribution of invasive mysterysnails in PISP with a series of three mark-recapture studies in PISP throughout summer 2023. We also completed analysis of metal contaminants within their shells and soft tissues to further investigate their potential negative impact in the ecosystem.\n\n\n\nMysterysnails (Cipangopaludina spp.) tagged at Presque Isle State Park, Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

    "text": "The Future of Using Social Media as a Scientist\n20 March 2025\nIn How to Be a Modern Scientist, Jeff Leek discusses the use of social media in science and its benefits for scientists. The book was published in 2016, and as you can imagine, the social media section can read as a bit dated. However, many of the points which still resonated with me and I believe can be updated or expanded on now. Here I will (briefly) modernize some of Leek’s thoughts and further discuss using social media as a scientist. Leek notes that the two things you should do to establish a successful social media presence as a scientist are 1. develop a following within your scientific community, and 2. use your social media as a way to bring more attention to your work. This general structure still applies now, in 2025, though this can look a lot different depending on your field or your goals when using social media.\nSince 2016, the kinds of social media platforms available and the content found on them have shifted. For example, one of the largest social media platforms in the United States, particularly with younger people, is TikTok, which is centered around short video content. This type of content now dominates many social media platforms, which have introduced similar short video formats for content (e.g., reels on Instagram and Facebook). There are many other shifts in the way social media is used now, such as the increased emphasis on monetization for content creators and personalization of content feeds for content consumers.\nThis can all sound intimidating if you are trying to use social media for professional reasons. However, some of these changes aren’t completely relevant if you only plan to use social media to make connections with other scientists, share your work, and provide commentaries on others’ work (as Leek suggests). Though, I do think it is important to be mindful of these shifts when navigating social media. For example, it may be more difficult for your professional content to reach its target audience if you only utilize images and text. I believe it is becoming more and more important to learn to utilize and interact with a variety of content types (e.g., short-form videos in addition to images and tweets) to develop a more prominent social media presence. That being said, many of the professionals I follow on social media do not utilize short form video content much, if at all. Your approach when curating your social media accounts will vary based on your professional goals.\nSomething that Leek did not touch on in How to be a Modern Scientist is the use of social media for scientists concerned with community outreach. The kind of work that I hope to do in the future would greatly benefit from the use of social media, not only for connecting with other scientists and sharing my work, but also as a means for community outreach and engagement. Leek suggests avoiding “hot button” issues, unless you really care about them. This can be incredibly difficult to navigate on social media, especially in the context of community outreach or spreading awareness about scientific issues. As Leek notes, opinions become amplified on social media, which has not changed. Though I think most would agree that many scientific issues have become incredibly divisive, at least in the United States. This is particularly relevant if one of your professional goals is to interact with a non-scientific community, and this is something that I (and others) will have to consider when developing my social media presence.\nI currently use social media professionally to view others’ thoughts and work, though I have yet to develop a true professional social media presence for myself. As someone early in their scientific career, the potential benefits of using a social media cannot be overstated. Leek provides a nice outline with tips which I plan to take into consideration as I further develop my professional social media accounts, while also being sure to modernize my approach."
