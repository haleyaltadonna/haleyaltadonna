    "text": "Welcome!\nHello, my name is Haley and I am a first-year PhD student in the Benard Lab at Case Western Reserve University’s Biology Department. I completed a B.S. in biology in May 2024 at Penn State Behrend in Erie, Pennsylvania.\nMy research interests include behavioral ecology and herpetology (i.e., the study of amphibians and reptiles). In particular, I am interested in studying amphibian responses to anthropogenic disturbances, such as habitat destruction and degradation. These activities threaten over 40% of amphibian species across the world, making them the most-threatened group of vertebrates. I hope to use my work to inform conservation efforts that protect these animals.\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential collaborations.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

For a full list of my previous research projects, please see my curriculum vitae.\n\nInvestigating Transgenerational Epigenetic Effects in a Freshwater Snail\nOrganisms’ observable characteristics can be altered by direct experiences (i.e., within-generation plasticity), or experiences of previous generations (i.e., transgenerational plasticity). Transgenerational plasticity can help offspring overcome environmental stressors, like predators, by using information about the environment that is passed from the genes of their parent(s). In certain species, such as simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can reproduce by either mating with others or self-fertilizing, the quantity of inherited information may be different between offspring. Physa are a genus of freshwater snails that are simultaneous hermaphrodites and can produce offspring by either mechanism. The objective of my work was to compare the transgenerational effects of predation risk in Physa offspring produced by mating versus by self-fertilization.\n\n\n\nSnail egg mass under a microscope (Physa spp.)\n\n\n\n\nDetermining the Population Size of Spotted Salamanders\nHumans can negatively impact amphibian populations by degrading and fragmenting their natural habitats. In the early 2000s, a large roadway was constructed on Penn State Behrend’s campus, which separated several ponds and other wetland habitats. Many species of amphibians, including spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) migrate to these ponds annually to breed. Habitat fragmentation and degradation may impact the size and success of their population at these locations. The objective of this work was to estimate the population size of spotted salamanders at ponds on campus using mark-recapture methods.\n\n\n\nAdult spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum)\n\n\n\n\nInvestigating the population size of invasive Mysterysnails\nInvasive species threaten native communities by competing with native species and reducing biodiversity. Non-native mysterysnails (Cipangopaludina spp.) are aquatic snails native to Asia. They were introduced into the United States via the pet trade and have been established as an invasive population in Presque Isle State Park (PISP), in Erie, Pennsylvania. However, the size and distribution of the population is unknown. The objective of this work was to determine the abundance and distribution of invasive mysterysnails in PISP with a series of three mark-recapture studies in PISP throughout summer 2023. We also completed analysis of metal contaminants within their shells and soft tissues to further investigate their potential negative impact in the ecosystem.\n\n\n\nMysterysnails (Cipangopaludina spp.) tagged at Presque Isle State Park, Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"
